You are an expert in language model compression. Please rewrite each sentence according to the following rules:
1. Preserve the original meaning.
2. Improve fluency and readability (avoid template-like or fragmented phrases).
3. Increase linguistic diversity (use varied sentence structures and natural connectors).
4. Do not remove important details such as location names, object names, or dates.
5. Output one clean, rewritten sentence only.
